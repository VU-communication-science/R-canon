The covariance can be any number, while the correlation is always between -1 and 1.\n2. The covariance depends on the scale of the variables. \n\nTo illustrate this, let's compare two scenarios.\nThe first scenario is the same as the strong positive correlation from the previous example.\nIn the second scenario, we have only multiplied V2 by 2, thus changing the scale of the variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](covariance-and-correlation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nOn the left we see the same scenario as before, with a positive correlation of $r = 0.869$.\nThe covariance here is $cov = 2.188$.\n\nOn the right we see the data where we multiplied V2 by 2.\nVisually, this looks like stretching the line vertically.\nThe data still *moves* the same way, but the steps are twice as big.\n\nFor the correlation between V1 and V2 ($r = 0.869$), this does not matter, because the scales of the variables are standardized.\nBut the covariance ($cov = 4.236$) *has* changed!",
