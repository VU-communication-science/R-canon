It includes an experiment to measure the effect of **watching moview *about* journalism** on people's **trust in journalists**, and includes a range of measures about the participants.\n\n**Number of participants (n)**: 600\n\n**Variables**:\n\n\n| Variable name | Type | Description |\n|---------------|------|-------------|\n| **id** | `numeric` | Unique identifier for each participant |\n| **age** | `numeric` | Age of the participant in years |\n| **np_subscription** | `factor` | Whether the participant has a newspaper subscription (`yes`, `no`) |\n| **news_consumption** | `numeric` | Average number of hours per week the participant consumes news |\n| **experiment_group** | `factor` | Type of movie shown: `neutral` (control group), `positive` (positive portrayal of journalism), `negative` (negative portrayal of journalism) |\n| **trust_t1** | `numeric` | Trust in journalists before the experiment (range: 1-10) |\n| **trust_t2** | `numeric` | Trust in journalists after the experiment (range: 1-10) |\n\n\n## Reading the data into R\n\nThe following code reads the practice data into R.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nd <- read_csv('https://tinyurl.com/R-practice-data')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWe will explain this code in the next tutorials, and also include it at the top of each tutorial that uses it.\n\n\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/R-practice-data",
