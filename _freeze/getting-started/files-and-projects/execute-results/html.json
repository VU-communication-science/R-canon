Also\nIt kind of looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n/ (Root Directory) \n│\n├── Documents\n│   ├── Work\n│   │   ├── survey.csv\n│   │   └──  \n│   └── Personal\n│       ├── Resume.pdf\n│       └── Budget.xlsx\n│\n├── Downloads\n│   ├── Report.docx\n│   └── image.jpg\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nBecause of this structure, any file on your computer has a unique **path** that describes its location in the file system.\nFor example, the path to the `Report.docx` file in the `Work` directory would be `/Documents/Work/survey.csv` (or `C:\\Documents\\Work\\survey.csv` on Windows). \nIn reality there are more layers, such as your user directory, but you get the gist.\n\nTo write or read a file in R, you can specify the file path in two ways: using an **absolute path** (starting from the root directory) or a **relative path** (starting from the current working directory).\n\n## Absolute path\n\nAn absolute path specifies the full path to a file or directory from the root directory.\nThere are several ways to find out the absolute path of a file on your computer:\n\n- **From the file explorer**: Open the file explorer on your computer, and navigate to the file. You can then right-click on the file and select *Properties* (or some similar term). Here you'll find the *Location* of the file. **Even easier**: you can right-click on the file and copy it, and when you then paste it into RStudio, it will paste the file path.\n- **Using file.choose()**: If you run the code `file.choose()`, R will open a file explorer window. Here you can browse to the file, and when you select it, R will print the file path in the console window.\n- **Using RStudio**: For some types of files, you can use the RStudio *data importer* interface. In the bottom-right window, you can go to the `Files` tab. Here you can browse to the file on your computer. If the file is something that you can read into R (e.g., a CSV file), RStudio will give you the `Import Dataset` option. This will open a visual interface for importing the data, that also shows the file path.\n\n\n## Relative path\n\nWhenever you are working in R, you are always working in a specific directory on your computer. \nThis directory is called the **working directory**.\nYou can check the current working directory with the `getwd()` function:\nThis prints the current working directory in your console. \n\nFor example, say that our current working directory is `/Documents/Work` (in the example file system above).\nThis allows us to access the `survey.csv` file with a relative path: `survey.csv`.\nAlso, if we would now create a new file in R called `my_analysis.r`, it would be saved as `/Documents/Work/my_analysis.r`.\n\nIn other words, by setting our working directory, we can avoid having to write out the full path to a file every time we want to read or write.\nThere are two easy ways to set the working directory in R:\n\n* **Manually**: You can set the working directory with the `setwd()` function. For example, to set the working directory to `/Documents/Work`, you can run `setwd(\"/Documents/Work\")`.\n* **Using RStudio**: In RStudio, you can set the working directory by clicking on `Session` in the menu bar, then `Set Working Directory`, and then `Choose Directory`. This will open a file explorer window where you can select the directory you want to set as the working directory.\n\n\n# Projects\n\nSetting your working directory can be a good way to manage files on your on computer.\nHowever, if you are working on a project, it can be even more convenient to start an actual **project** in RStudio.\n\nIn the top-right corner of your RStudio window, you can see a button labeled **Project: (None)**.\nIf you click it, you can create a new project. \nYou can create this project in a new or existing directory on your computer.\nThis will mark the directory as a project, and in the top-right corner you will see the name of the project instead of **Project: (None)**.\n\nProjects are very convenient because they allow you to store all your files and data for a project in a single directory.\nThe working directory is automatically set to the project directory, and you can easily access all files in the project from the RStudio interface.\nMoreover, if you share the project with others, they can easily open the project in RStudio and start working on it.\nAs long as you make sure to save all files in the project directory, and use relative paths to access files, your code will work on any computer.\n",
