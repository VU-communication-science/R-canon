Install a package\n\nMost packages are available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), which is the main repository for R packages.\nTo install these packages, all you need to know is their name.\n\nFor example, there is a package called `lubridate` that makes it easier to work with dates and times in your data.\nTo install this package, you can use the `install.packages()` function:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"lubridate\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## 2. Load a package\n\nOnce you have installed a package, it is not yet loaded into your current R session.\nSimilar to when you install a new app on your phone, you need to open it every time you want to use it.\n\nTo use a package in your current R session, you can load it with the `library()` function:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lubridate)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# How do I know how to use a package?\n\nMost packages come with good documentation that explains how to use the functions in the package.\nFor individual functions you can use the `?` operator to open the help page for that function, as we explain in [here](../good-to-know/function-documentation.qmd).\nBut there is often also a more general documentation that explains the package as a whole.\nThis is called a **vignette**, and if a package has one, you can open it with the `vignette()` function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvignette(\"lubridate\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nYou can look up vignettes and function documentation [online](https://www.rdocumentation.org/). \nThis is also a good way to find new packages for whatever you're trying to do.\n\n",
