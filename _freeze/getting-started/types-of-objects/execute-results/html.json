For instance, your numeric data might have been read in as a character object.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumber <- \"5\"    \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIf I want to perform mathematical operations on `number`, I need to first convert it to a numeric object.\nYou can do this using the `as.numeric` function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumber <- as.numeric(number)\nnumber\nclass(number)    # numeric\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNote that you cannot always convert objects to a different type.\nJust use your common sense here.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas.numeric(\"I am not a number\") \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhen coercion is not possible, R will return `NA` (missing value) and give you a warning.\n\n\n# From single values to large data set\n\nIn practice, you'll rarely work with single values alone. \nHowever, many operations you can perform on a single value can also be applied to multiple values at once. \nUnderstanding how individual values combine to form larger data structures is key to working effectively with data.\n\n## From Single Values to Vectors\n\nA vector is a collection of values of the same type (e.g., all numeric or all character). You create a vector by combining individual values using the `c()` (combine) function.\nJust like with single numbers, a vector has a type.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nclass(numbers)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"numeric\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can perform operations on the entire vector at once:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumbers * 10\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 10 20 30 40 50\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum(numbers)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 15\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## From Vectors to Data Frames\n\nSingle vectors are still not very usefull for data analysis, since we're often interested in relations between variables.\nThis is where data frames come in.\n\nA data frame is a table with rows and columns, where each row is an observation and each column is a variable.\nYou can think of a data frame as a collection of vectors, where each vector represents a column in the dataset.\nWe can create a data frame by combining vectors using the `data.frame()` function.[^1]\n\n[^1]: Throughout this book we will actually be using the `tibble` data structure from the `tidyverse` package, which is an improved version of the `data.frame`. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncountry <- c(\"NL\", \"NL\", \"BE\", \"BE\", \"DE\", \"DE\", \"FR\", \"FR\", \"UK\", \"UK\")\nheight  <- c(176 , 165 , 172 , 160 , 180 , 170 , 175 , 165 , 185 , 175 )\n\nd <- data.frame(country, height)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can perform operations on the entire data frame at once!\nYou can for instance perform a statistical test to see if the average height differs between countries.\n\nAnd just like with single values and vectors, we need to take the type of each column into account.\nFor instance, we can't perform a correlation analysis using the `country` column, because it's a character vector.\n\n\n",
