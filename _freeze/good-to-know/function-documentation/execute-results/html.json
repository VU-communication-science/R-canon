For example, if you want to learn more about the `mean()` function, you would type:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n?mean\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will open the help page, often in the bottom right pane of RStudio.\n\n## How to read the help page\n\nThe help page for a function is divided into several sections. \nThe most important sections are:\n\n### Description\n\nA brief description of what the function does.\nFor the `mean()` function, the description is: *Generic Function for the (Arithmetic) Mean*.\n\nBy generic function, they mean that the function can have multiple implementations.\nWhen you think of the mean, you are probably thinking of the mean of a vector of numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx = c(1,2,3,4)\nmean(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nBut you can do more!\nFor example, you can also calculate the mean of a vector of `Date` values:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndates = as.Date(c(\"2021-01-01\", \"2021-01-03\"))\nmean(dates)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"2021-01-02\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Usage\n\nThe syntax of the function, including all the arguments it takes.\nFor example, the `mean()` function has the following usage:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(x, ...)\n\n## Default S3 method:\nmean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first part tells you that the most basic way to use the function is to provide an argument called `x`. What `x` is, is explained in the *arguments* section that we discuss below.\n\nThe `...` at the end means that the function can take additional arguments. \nThis is because the mean function is a *generic function*.\nDepending on the type of input you provide (e.g., numbers, dates), some arguments might not be relevant.\n\nThe second part tells you that the default method for the mean function has two additional arguments in addition to `x`: `trim`, and `na.rm`.\nNote an important difference with the `x` argument: these arguments have default values (0 and FALSE, respectively).\nThis means that these arguments are **optional**.\nIf you don't specify them, the function will use these default values.\n\nFor example, notice that the `na.rm` argument is set to `FALSE` by default. \nAs we can see in the Arguments section, this means that the function will not remove missing values by default.\n(`NA` stands for `Not Available`, and is used in R to indicate missing values, so `na.rm` is short for `remove NAs`).\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx_with_missing <- c(1, 2, 3, NA, 4)\nmean(x_with_missing)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] NA\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to remove missing values, we can set `na.rm` to `TRUE`:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(x_with_missing, na.rm=TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"To name or not to name your arguments\" collapse=\"true\"}\n\nNotice how in the code above we specify the argument name `na.rm = TRUE` to indicate that we want to use this optional argument.\nFor the `x` argument we don't need to specify the argument name, because it's the first argument and the function knows that the first argument is `x`.\nGenerally speaking, if you don't specify the argument name, R will assume that you are providing the arguments in the order that they are listed in the usage section.\nLet's think a bit about when we should and should not use argument names!\n\nYou *could* decide to always use argument names:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(x=x_with_missing, na.rm=TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is fine, and sometimes you might want to do this for sake of clarity.\nBut it's also often unnecessary.\nFor the `mean` function, it is obvious that the first argument is the input over which you want to calculate the mean, so you don't need to specify the argument name.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, you could decide to never use argument names:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(x_with_missing, 0, TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nHere the three arguments follow the order in the usage section: `x`, `trim`, `na.rm`.\n\nThis has two obvious downsides:\n\n* It is not obvious what the `0` and `TRUE` arguments are. The reader might thus have to look up the function documentation.\n* We now also need to specify the `trim` argument, because it comes before `na.rm` in the usage section.\n\nSo in general, it is often good to use argument names for optional arguments, like `na.rm`.\nFor required arguments, like `x`, it is often not necessary.\nArguably the *best* way to use the `mean` function with `na.rm` is therefore:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(x_with_missing, na.rm=TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2.5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n### Arguments\n\nA description of all the arguments that the function takes.\nThis should cover all the arguments that are listed in the usage section.\n\nFor example, the `mean()` function explains that the `x` argument is can be a numeric vector, but also something like a `logical` or `date` vector.\nFor the `na.rm` argument it explains that if set to `TRUE`, missing values will be removed before calculating the mean.\n\n### Value\n\nThe value section explains what the function returns (i.e. the output).\n\n### Examples\n\nThe examples section shows you how to use the function.\nHonestly, this is often the most useful part of the help page.\nIf you are not sure how to use a function, a great way to learn is to look at the examples.\nUsually, you can directly copy-paste these examples into your script and run them to see how the function works.\n\n\n# Using tab completion\n\n\nA very usefull trick in RStudio, and in programming in general, is to use tab completion.\nThe tab key on your keyboard (the one above the caps lock key) can be used to complete the name of a function or variable.\nAnd if there are multiple ways in which the name can be completed, R will show you all the options.\n(On some devices you might need to press `Tab` twice, or it might not work at all).\n\nFor example, type the following code in your R script:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nNow place your cursor between the parentheses and press the `Tab` key.\nThis should now list all the arguments for the `mean` function, including their descriptions!\n\nSince the mean function is empty, you should only have seen the `x` argument (and the `...` argument).\nBut you can also use tab completion when adding additional arguments.\nType the following code in your R script:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx = c(1,2,3,4)\nmean(x, )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nNow place your cursor between the parentheses after the comma, and press the `Tab` key.\nNow you should see the `trim` and `na.rm` arguments, because RStudio knows that these arguments apply to a `mean` function with a numeric input!\n\n## Try using tab completion everywhere\n\nWell ok, not everywhere. But you might be surprised how often it can help you.\nIt can even help you find files on your computer.\nIf you use tab completion between quotes, RStudio will show you all the files in your working directory that match the characters you've typed so far.\nSo you can use this inside functions like `read_csv` to quickly find the file you want to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nread_csv(\"\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out!",
