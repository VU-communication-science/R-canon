# What is the correlation test?

The correlation test can be used to see if there is `a relationship between two numeric variables`.
For example, we might want to know if there is a relationship between the amount of time people spend on social media and their feelings of loneliness.

The relation is expressed as a measure (the correlation coefficient) on a scale from -1 to 1, that tells us how strong the relationship is, and whether it is positive or negative.
We also get a p-value that tells us if the relationship is significant.
In this tutorial we focus on conducting the test. For more details on the concept of correlation and how to interpret the correlation coefficient $r$, see the [covariance and correlation](../concepts/covariance-and-correlation.qmd) section.

What the correlation test **does not** tell us is why the relationship exists.
If we find that there is a correlation between social media use and loneliness, it does not mean that social media use causes loneliness.
For more detail on this, see the [causality](../concepts/causality.qmd) section.

# How to use it

We'll show two ways of conducting the correlation test: using the `cor.test` function and using the `tab_corr` function from the `sjPlot` package.
The `cor.test` function is part of the base R package, and is usefull if you just have two variables.
The `tab_corr` function is part of the `sjPlot` package, and is useful if you have multiple variables and want to see the correlations between all of them.

To demonstrate the correlation test, we'll use the practice data that we've used before.
```{r, message=F}
library(tidyverse)
d <- read_csv("https://tinyurl.com/R-practice-data") |>
        rename(news_consumption = `news consumption`)
```

## Between two variables: cor.test

In the practice data we have variables for the `news_consumption` of the participants, and their `trust_t1` in the news media (measured before the experiment).
These are both numeric variables, so we can use the correlation test to see if there is a relationship between them. 

To perform the correlation test using the `cor.test` function, we pass the two variables to the function.
Recall that we can use the `$` symbol to access variables in a data frame.
So here we access the `news_consumption` and `trust_t1` variables from the `d` data frame.

```{r}
cor.test(d$news_consumption, d$trust_t1)
```

The output gives us the correlation coefficient under the `sample estimates`, which in our case is $r = 0.107$.
This means that the correlation is positive (> 0), but quite weak.
The test also reports a p-value (`0.009`), which tells us that the correlation is significant at the $99\%$ (`< 0.01`) confidence level. 
Also note that the degrees of freedom are reported as `598`, which is the number of observations minus 2.

It is also possible to use the formula notation in the `cor.test` function.
However, this looks a bit weird, because in the correlation tests there are no dependent variables, since we are **just looking at the relationship**.
The convention for formulas in R is to use the `~` symbol to separate the dependent and independent variables (`dependent ~ independent_1 + independent_2 + ...`).
For the correlation test, we would just omit the dependent variable.
So for the example above, the code would look like this:

```{r, results='hide'}
cor.test(~ news_consumption + trust_t1, data = d)
```
:::

## Between more variables: tab_corr

If we need to see the correlations between multiple variables, we can use the `tab_corr` function from the `sjPlot` package.
For example, let's look at the correlations between the 5 items used to calculate the `trust_t1` scale.
To use `tab_corr`, we can simply pass a data frame with the variables we want to use.
Here we use the `select` function to select all columns from `trust_t1_item1` to `trust_t1_item5`.

```{r, message=F}
library(sjPlot)
d |>
    select(trust_t1_item1:trust_t1_item5) |>
    tab_corr()
```

This is great for getting a quick overview of the relationships between multiple variables.
If you need to get the exact p-values, you can also use `tab_corr(p.numeric = TRUE)`.


# When can you use it?

The correlation test is used when you have two `numeric` variables and you want to know if there is a relationship between them.
There is no `dependent` or `independent` variable in the correlation test, because we are just looking at the relationship between the variables.   

There are three main conditions that need to be met for the correlation test to be valid:

1. **Continuous variables**: Both variables should be numeric, and measured on a interval or ratio scale.
2. **Linearity**: The relationship between the variables should be linear.
3. **Normality**: The variables should be (roughly) normally distributed. Correlation is particularly sensitive to outliers.

If these conditions are not met, you might want to use Spearman's $\rho$ or Kendall's $\tau$ instead of the Pearson correlation coefficient.

## Spearman's $\rho$ and Kendall's $\tau$

To use the Spearman's $\rho$ or Kendall's $\tau$ correlation, you need to specify the `method` argument in the `cor.test` function, or the `corr.method` argument in the `tab_corr` function.

```{r, results='hide', warning=F, message=F}
cor.test(d$news_consumption, d$trust_t1, method = "spearman")
cor.test(d$news_consumption, d$trust_t1, method = "kendall")

d |> select(trust_t1_item1:trust_t1_item5) |> tab_corr(corr.method="spearman")
d |> select(trust_t1_item1:trust_t1_item5) |> tab_corr(corr.method="kendall")
```



# How to report it

For APA style reporting of the correlation test you need to know the `correlation coefficient`, `p-value`, and the `degrees of freedom`. 
You can find all these values in the output of the `cor.test` function.[^1] 

[^1]: When using `tab_corr`, you can use the `p.numeric = TRUE` argument to get the p-values.
The degrees of freedom is always the number of observations minus 2, but be carefull not to count missing (NA) values.  

The formula for reporting the results of a correlation test in APA style is:

r(`degrees of freedom`) = `correlation coefficient`, p = `p-value`.

* the `correlation coefficient` is rounded to two decimal places, and the number before the decimal point is ommited if zero (`.11` instead of `0.11`).
* The `p-value` is reported for the smallest significant level (`p < 0.05`, `p < 0.01` or `p < 0.001`), or in full with three decimal places if not significant (`p = 0.123`).



In our example above we observed a correlation coefficient of $r = 0.107$ with a p-value of $p = 0.009$, and $598$ degrees of freedom. 
So we would report this as:

> There is a positive correlation between age and trust in journalists, $r(598) = .12$, $p < 0.01$.
