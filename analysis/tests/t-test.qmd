# What is a t-test?

A t-test is a statistical test used to determine if there is a significant difference between two means. It is typically used when the data is approximately normally distributed. The t-test is based on the t-distribution, which is similar to the normal distribution.
The key differences are that a normal distribution assumes that the population standard deviation is known, while a t-distribution assumes that the population standard deviation is unknown and must be estimated from the sample data.
By adjusting for the uncertainty in the estimate of the population standard deviation, the t-distribution provides a more accurate estimate of the standard error of the mean when the sample size is small.

The t-test can be used for testing simple hypotheses that concern the difference between two means. 
There are tree main types of t-tests:

* **One-sample t-test**: 
  * **Purpose**. Compare the mean of a single sample to a known value (e.g., a population mean).
  * **Example**. You have a sample of students and you want to test if the average score is significantly different from the national average.
* **Independent samples t-test**: 
  * **Purpose**. Compare the means *between* two independent groups. 
  * **Example**. You conducted an experiment where you measured a variable in two groups (e.g., a *treatment* and a *control* group) and you want to test if the means are significantly different.
* **Paired samples t-test**: 
  * **Purpose**. Compare the means *within subjects* (e.g., within a person) at two different time points or under two different conditions. In this case the samples are not independent, because the two observations are *paired*.
  * **Example**. You measured a variable in the same group of subjects before and after an intervention, and you want to test if the mean difference is significant.

You will also encounter the t-test in other contexts, such as testing the significance of individual coefficients in a regression model (i.e. is the coefficient significantly different from zero?).
In this tutorial we will focus on t-test as a standalone test for comparing two means.
